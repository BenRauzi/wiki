# Dev environment setup

Install the following,

* [Node.js (`>=10.16.3`)](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
* [Yarn (`>= 1.19.0`)](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Windows setup

Run the docker desktop app to make sure it runs without errors. It may prompt you to go through a few steps to update system settings. 

You may need to enable hardware assisted virtualization following the steps [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/troubleshoot/#virtualization-must-be-enabled).

You will need the [Windows Subsystem for Linux set up]([https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10]).

## CENNZnet development


## Rust
The recommended way to install Rust is to follow the official instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Windows Subsystem for Linux
Note that if you want to build Cennznet locally(instead of running a docker image) on Windows, you may need to use the Linux subsystem. You can follow the instructions here to [Setting up Linux subsystem on Windows](CENNZnet-development/Guides/Set-up-Linux-Sub-system-for-Windows).
