# Types of nodes

There are a few types of nodes in CENNZnet.

## Archive Nodes

The Archive Nodes contain the full history from the start of CENNZNet. This requires a larger amount of storage space. We recommend allocating at least 250G of disk space for Archive Nodes.

Validators need to use Archive Nodes.

## Full Nodes

The Full Nodes contain the history of the last 256 blocks. This allows you to interact with the chain, but doesnâ€™t have the history of earlier blocks.

DApps can connect to a Full Node or an Archive Node to communicate with CENNZnet.
