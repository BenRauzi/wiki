# Types of nodes

There are a few types of nodes in CENNZnet.

## Archive Nodes

An Archive Node contains the full history from the start of CENNZNet. This requires a larger amount of storage space. We recommend allocating at least 250G of disk space for Archive Nodes.

Validators need to use Archive Nodes.

## Full Nodes

A Full Node contains the history of the last 256 blocks. This allows you to interact with the chain, but doesnâ€™t have the history of earlier blocks.

DApps can connect to a Full Node or an Archive Node to communicate with CENNZnet.

## Light Nodes

A Light Node contain only the runtime and the current state. It doesn't store past extrinsics and so cannot restore the full chain from genesis. 

Light nodes are useful for resource restricted devices. A use-case of light nodes is a Chrome extension, which is a node in its own right, running the runtime in WASM format.
