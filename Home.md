## Intro
CENNZnet is a public blockchain based on Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus built on top of the [Plug](https://github.com/plugblockchain/plug-blockchain/) framework.

The PoS algorithm facilitates fairness compared to the widely used Proof of Work algorithm through a process of staking.

It also allows CENNZ holders to participate in the process of staking and get rewarded for it.
CENNZnet implements a decentralised currency exchange (CENNZX), fully managed by users, providing spot price trades and integrated multi-currency fee payment.

Decentralized applications (DApps) built on CENNZnet can seamlessly interact with the users of other DApps.

## Quick Start

Start a full node named `my-node` and connect it to the CENNZnet MainNet:
```bash
# via docker
$ docker run cennznet/cennznet:1.3.0 \
    --chain=/cennznet/genesis/azalea.raw.json \
    --name=my-node \
    --telemetry-url 'ws://cennznet-telemetry.centrality.me:1024 0'

# via source
git clone https://github.com/cennznet/cennznet && git checkout release/1.3.0
cd cennznet && cargo build --release
./target/release/cennznet \
    --chain=./genesis/azalea.raw.json \
    --name=my-node \
    --telemetry-url 'ws://cennznet-telemetry.centrality.me:8000/submit 0'
```

Check `my-node` is running [here](http://cennznet-telemetry.centrality.me/#/CENNZnet-Azalea).
